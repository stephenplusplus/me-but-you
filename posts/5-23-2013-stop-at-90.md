# stop at 90.
## being a know it all is flippin' hard.

I decided a couple of years ago I wanted to be an expert in everything. I read the books, the blogs, the tweets, the feeds, the expensive British magazines from Barnes & Noble. It wasn't until recently I learned if I ever call myself an "expert," I will have failed.

I am definitely not the greatest programmer. Quite far from it. I know there are more experienced, greater minds out there. Years ago, I thought of myself in competition with them. I wanted to out-know them in everything that made them successful and respected. That's not only the absolute wrong way to live your life and start your career-- it's rather childish, as well.

In the coming years, I would get some experience working with other people, many of whom were examples of those "more experienced, greater minds" types. It quickly hit me that these weren't people to put myself in a ring with; they were my buds. People who were spilling with smart, that if I wasn't around to see it, I wouldn't have been able to scoop it up.

Under the same roof, I met many great people who reminded me of myself not long before. I recognized some of their struggles, and knew exactly how to help them. It was around the first year mark of my career that I realized what the rest of my engineer years would be for. To learn, and share. It's like Barney all over again.

So, what I remind myself of when I think I'm getting too deep into something: stop at 90. Don't try to learn everything about everything. It will not only burn you out, it will force you to turn away other exciting opportunities. Example: if you want to change the world with your product and care about the performance benefits of bitwise operators in your JavaScript, you might want to "stop at 90." You know enough about what you need to know. Spend your brain's power and patience for detail on something else. Pick another topic, and google it. Heck, pick 9 more topics, and "stop at 10" on each. It's better to know a bit about how everything works than everything about how one thing works.

Learn. Change. Share.
