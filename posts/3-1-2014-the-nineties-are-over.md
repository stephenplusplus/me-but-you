# The nineties are over.

### So, why do you still need to choose a browser?

In 1998, the advantages were aplenty:

One was *faster* than the other.

Or, it was *free*.

Or, it was *cheap*.

Or, the interface wasn't as bloated and the colors were *prettier*.

Or, it came with "*channels*."

Or, it promised *virus protection* and *less ads*.

### But, it's 2014.

#### *The landscape has changed.*

We don't need to be coddled into our entrance to the mystical "Internet." It's everywhere we look, because we bring it with us everywhere we go. Regardless of the device or the platform, all browsers follow the basic rules: be a window to the web, offering minimal, out-of-the-way features, such as bookmarks and add-ons.

So, why do we need variety in the browser marketplace? It's not even a marketplace. I don't care what brand the windshield on my car is. It does an amazing job at what it's supposed to do (squashing bugs and keeping my hair lookin' awesome), but it's not something I need to think about. It's a window to the world, just like the browser.

It's a wee too late to treat this "vision" as realistic. Some companies' existences are predicated on their browser. They'd be squashed like one of those bugs on my windshield if we all just decide on Chrome one day.

Still, you have to constantly remind yourself when things around you don't make sense, and not just take them for granted. That's when your mind loses its value&mdash; uniqueness&mdash; and starts to follow patterns that someone else gave it.

Stay sharp. Question how we came to this *reality*, as you choose to experience it.

*But, seriously, can we stick to one browser?*
